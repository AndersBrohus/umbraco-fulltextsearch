Umbraco Full Text Search Web API.
            
This package is an addon to the Governor Technology Full Text Search package. It adds a Web API which can be used to trigger re-indexing of some, or all nodes on a site. The intention of this is for it to be used to schedule regular re-indexing on sites where content changes without pages being published.
