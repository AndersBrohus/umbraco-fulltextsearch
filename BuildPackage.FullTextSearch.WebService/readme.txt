Umbraco Full Text Search Web Service.
            
This package is an addon to the Governor Technology Full Text Search package. It adds a web service which can be used to trigger
re-indexing of some, or all nodes on a site. The intention of this is for it to be used to schedule regular re-indexing on sites
where content changes without pages being published.
